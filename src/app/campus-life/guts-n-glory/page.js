        </div>

            With the worldwide shortage of qualified engineers expected to hit a critical point in the next 15 years, now might just be the best time in history to come out of College with an engineering degree. This demand for technical talent is certainly great news for anyone entering the engineering profession. But to paraphrase the old business institute saying, “with success comes increased competition.” And you can be sure the best jobs go to the best prepared.
          </p>

          <div className="quote-banner">
            "You may have heard that engineering is a man’s world... Wait a second, though! Is it really all about nuts and bolts, spanners and screwdrivers? Definitely not."
          </div>

          <p>
            Furthermore, you may have heard that the world of engineering is full of men who have all the technical skills in the world, but no social skills to match. In many people’s minds, an engineering career is a constant love affair between a man and his machines. And do women actually work in engineering? Of course they do! Now the time has changed and women are equally superior in all respect. Forget anything you’ve heard previously! Before you make the decision to get into engineering, you should firstly discover what it’s really all about.
          </p>

          <p>
            Engineers are all about solving problems using specialist technical and practical skills. It’s all about maths, science, research, prototypes, design, maintenance and production. Every industry and every area of society depends on the precise and efficient work of engineers. The engineers provide technological solutions to the problems, issues and ideas that affect every area of our lives. They design, manufacture and maintain almost everything people and industries use, from computers, spacecraft and boats to corkscrews, buildings and chemical reactors. Technological advances would never happen without engineers. Consequently, the people who work in this sector are massively important in developing the future of our society.
          </p>

          <p>
            There are so many different areas of engineering to work in; however, most engineers choose to specialise in just one, such as Electrical, automotive or robotics. Careers in engineering are constantly evolving and new processes and technologies are being developed all the time. This allows engineers to stay on the ball and react to new problems and challenges in their chosen field. Engineering careers are constantly varied in terms of their job responsibilities, but also in their working locations. As an engineer you could be working in an office, in a laboratory, on an oil rig in the middle of the ocean, in a factory, or even in outer space. Each engineering discipline requires professionals with very specific skill-sets. However, each and every area of this sector is as complex as the next. Consequently, all engineers need to have strong mathematical skills, logic and the ability to rise to intellectual and practical challenges. If you've got what it takes, you might be a successful engineering professional. Jaipur Engineering College is dedicated to produce best quality engineers. Here are some of the briefs of young JECians who adopted strategies for being successful.

                Engineering College, as a discipline, ECE focuses on the design of underlying hardware systems. The curriculum is directed to applications in major areas such as telecommunications, energy and electronics sectors, while encouraging development of necessary skills for integration of hardware and software components. She believes that many creative opportunities exist at the boundaries of ECE, and she had accordingly planned for cross-training of students across disciplinary boundaries.

                Is hard core programming done by urban students only? If you think the answer is yes, think it over again. Sunil Sharma, a boy from a farmer family in rural India, became the Highest Paid Engineering Graduate of 2012 batch in Rajasthan! Sunil graduated in 2012 from JEC Group in Computer Engineering. He did his schooling from an obscure village Dehlal in Lalsot Tehsil of Dausa, Rajasthan. He was in 11th class, when he came across the word 'Engineer' for the first time! An year later, while filling the form for AIEEE, he saw computer in a local cyber cafe and got fascinated.
              </p>
              <p>
                Here was an engineering student who had used the computer for the very first time in First Semester... Internet for the first time in Second Semester. Yet he refused to give in. He pursued studies single-mindedly and became one of the most regular students of his college. He used to attend all the classes and listen to faculty members with rapt attention and respect. The guidance he got by being humble and courteous to teachers, helped him to cross the threshold of knowledge in few years.
              </p>
              <p>
                He mastered JAVA and Oracle and honed programming skills through taking up variety of projects. He excelled not only in academics but also created a website that offers customized IT solutions to clients spread across continents. When he was in second year, he started utilizing the huge potential of LinkedIn. He made large number of contacts through it and started sending his CV to top notch people of IT industry.
              </p>
              <p>
                By now he had a rich experience of making software for national and international clients. Noticing the spark in him, he was recommended to Tony and Joe's Seafood Place. Although this job opportunity was not for fresher graduates, yet Sunil got shortlisted for the technical round. His competitors were experienced professionals across the world and yet, an unlettered farmer's son surpassed them all, bagging first position internationally!
              </p>
              <p>
                He was offered a whooping monthly salary of 10270 USD in Tony and Joe's Sea Food Place, Washington DC.

Electrical engineers answer the tough electrical questions and may work on anything from handheld gadgets to massive electrical grids. In getting there, electrical engineers must consider questions such as: What level of degree should I get to maximize my income? What concentration should I learn to obtain my dream career? Do I have to join an engineering firm or can I work on my own?
