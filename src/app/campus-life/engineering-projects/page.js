                <h3>Thinking Beyond a Degree</h3>
                <p>Engineering projects involve creative problem solving of real world problems. So, JEC focuses on meaningful education and prepares students to think beyond a degree. Students learn how to work with other group members and present the progress to their peers and faculties.</p>
                <p>Engineering projects offer students with a platform to apply engineering to the real world, discover the joy of working in a team and extend the experience to new domains. They are eager to try, experiment and learn from their failures. Excellent projects are completed by students in previous academic sessions.</p>

                        In this project drilling machine uses pneumatic power instead of motor power. The drilling operation is carried out with the help of pneumatic cylinder which provides the up down motion to the drill tool. This project is very useful in industries in order to save time and manpower. Time control unit is used to control the drilling operation. It's a low cost multipurpose machine which can also carry out operations like grinding, screw driving with less consumption of time and high accuracy.

                        A rotating wheel is employed at the top of the wooden cardboard with the help of supporting dynamo board. This wheel is connected with a dynamo whose output is connected to a battery. In day time, when lamps are not in use we can charge the battery and power can be produced by rotating the wheel in any direction. This technique can be used in many places like parks, roads, children swings, etc. IIT-D, Sahara Hotel, Dubai, is currently using this technique.
