                <p>Agrasen College, established in 2018 as an affiliating college of the <strong>University of Rajasthan</strong>, has a story to tell... a success story.</p>
                <p>In the life span of an educational institution, two years may be just a tiny ray in the vast spectrum, but for Agrasen College, the last two years have been truly constructive, much like the building blocks. The blocks have been reconfigured time and again from simple structures to more comprehensive ones, in tandem with the emerging paradigms of the techno-savvy world of today.</p>
                <p>The college is a <strong>Co-Educational College</strong>, christened as Agrasen College, after a great Indian ruler. Catering to the educational demands of the thickly populated Jaipur and adjoining rural areas, the College is today attracting the student intelligentsia from various parts of Rajasthan.</p>
